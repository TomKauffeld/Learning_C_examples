# Learning C examples
This are some simple exercises with some examples.

## Getting Started
Clone (or download) the repository to your machine.
### Visual Studio 2019
Almost everything is already ready, you just need to open the ``Exercises.sln``

Then you can activate an Exercise by right clicking on one.

And select ``Set as StartUp Project`` in the menu.

After that you click on ``Local Windows Debugger`` on top to execute it.

### Compiling with GCC on Windows
go into an folder, example for exercise 1:
```bash
cd Exercise_1
```
run gcc, example for exercise 1 :
```bash
gcc *.c -o testHello.exe
```
and run the created program, example for exercise 1 :
```bash
./testHello.exe
```

### Compiling with GCC on Linux
almost the same thing as for Windows :
go into an folder, example for exercise 1:
```bash
cd Exercise_1
```
run gcc, example for exercise 1 :
```bash
gcc *.c -o testHello
```
and run the created program, example for exercise 1 :
```bash
./testHello
```

## Please note :
These examples do **NOT** show the optimal way of solving these exercises, nor the way you should code it.

They do however show the basics of how to code in the future :
 - it shows how to split your code in multiple files
 - it shows how to use header files
 - it shows how to use multiple functions

If there are questions, feel free to open an "issue" and I'll try to respond.

You can also ask for more exercises, and I'll try to create some examples.
